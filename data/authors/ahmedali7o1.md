My name is Ahmed Ali, a self-taught Software developer, started learning programming and coding in 2003. and later 2008, I started my professional career as a freelance web developer. And then, in 2016, I started my first full-time job as a Backend web developer. Currently, I live in Egypt and looking for overseas opportunities in Europe or North America; let me know if you have any? ðŸ˜€

My interests are around Backend, Security, Gaming and doing Open source projects. On my 30th birthday, I decided to create this blog to learn new stuff, do new projects, continue doing what interests me. And, of course, sharing it with the world. Because I believe this might help somebody with ideas, thinking or sharing the same interests. And it will, of course, allow me to learn from others as well.
